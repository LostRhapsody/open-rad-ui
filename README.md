# Open Radicle UI

An open-source user-interface and backend for displaying a radicle node's data in a user-friendly interface.

## Motivation

Radicle is everything I'm looking for in a 'git' platform. Except, there is no reliable UI. Their desktop app is, at the moment, broken (I couldn't install it on Arch Linux), and as far as I can tell, there is no way to host your own web UI.

My dream is to use radicle to host my organization's code, and of course my own. But hosting exclusively using the rad cli hurts unexperienced, UI-first developers, and prevents positive discoverability for open-source projects.

Hence, while Radicle is sorting out their own UI (They seem to be focusing on the protocol and CLI, which is ideal!), I've decided to act as a middle-man. I hope I get to use this with lots of cool and interesting projects!
